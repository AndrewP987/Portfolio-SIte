Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & jQuery, I designed a portfolio website. In this website, there are different sections about me: home, about me, 
the technologies that I use/familiar with, projects I've finished and uploaded to GitHub, & how to contact me. 

This website is not launched/hosted and was made for practice purposes. 

Below are some screenshots of the website on a live server using Visual Studio Code.
